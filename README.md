# Typing Speed Test
This front end web project is a typing speed test built with React and Typescript designed to measure typing speed and accuracy. The application manages time-based state, user input events, and UI updates using modular, type-safe component architecture.

### Features
- Randomized typing tests from a predefined word bank, producing a new sequence of words on each test restart
- Per-character visual feedback by dynamically updating letter styles based on input accuracy against expected characters
- Words per minute (WPM) and accuracy calculations, with WPM calculation depending on elapsed time and accuracy to avoid inflated results
- Configurable word count test options
- Selectable preset color themes using CSS runtime variables
